## things to keep in mind
* Always make use of the `help` command to ensure your users have a __documentation to help__ out when confused.
* Your application is performing a million operations behind the scenes. That’s why the user is employing your tool in the first place: to __reduce the complexity__ for them.
* __Helpful error messages__ when user input is incorrect, perhaps give them suggestions _"did you mean this?"_ or _"please use this date format... "_
* __Avoid inputs which are non-standard or cumbersome to enact.__ We don't want to annoy the user.
* Every detail matters on the command line: Things aren’t just a click away, the user has to define what they are looking to do with their keyboard.
* __Create commands that are intuitive__, hopefully easy to remember, else make good documentation so the user can figure it out.
